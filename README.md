# Normality-Assessment-Research

This repo contains R code that was used to generate datasets and corresponding QQ-plot visualizations, administer surveys (RShiny web applications), and store/analyze responses. The purpose of this research is to determine which variations of QQ-Plots enable viewers of all experience levels to accurately determine whether a dataset has a normally distributed parent population.
